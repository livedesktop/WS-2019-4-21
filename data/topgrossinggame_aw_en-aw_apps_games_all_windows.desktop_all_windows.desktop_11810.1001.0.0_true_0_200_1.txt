It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill!

and consuming other players to gain mass to grow the largest and longest in the game. Once the player starts the game and is spawned into the virtual world, their avatar cannot stop moving forward. If the player's worm's head collides into a part of another worm, the player will die. The defeated avatar's body turns into bright, shining pellets for other players to consume. As much pellets as it takes for the equivalent amount of mass as the worm had exactly before its death will be transmuted. These pellets that remain from \"death\" of an avatar will correspond to the color of the avatar itself, and are both brighter and bigger than \"normal\" pellets, which spawn naturally throughout the world. Normal pellets do not give as much mass as pellets dropped from other worms. \"Chase\" pellets will appear individually in various places of the world, and when eaten, give a greater amount of mass than pellets dropped by other worms. Chase pellets avoid worms and flee when they draw near. Chase pellets can be obtained by boosting.\r\n\r\nBy pressing and holding the space bar or left/right mouse button (on mobile, double-tapping the touchscreen), the player can use their boost, which causes the avatar to speed up. When the button (or, on mobile, the finger on the touchscreen) is released, the worm will stop using its boost. When a player uses their boost, the worm loses some mass, causing the worm's size to shrink slightly, with the mass that is lost from the boost appearing as a line of small pellets where the boost was used. The mass lost can be regained by consuming the pellets. Similar to pellets dropped from defeated avatars, the boost pellets correspond to the color of the avatar. The boost feature is useful to outmaneuver and defeat opponents.[4] A common strategy that is used by players to defeat opponents is of the player's avatar coiling around the opponent's in a loop, until the opponent, trapped in the loop, crashes into the player.\r\n\r\nThere is a border that confines avatars within the circular game board. If a worm hits the border, the player automatically dies without turning into the aforementioned pellets. As of now it is removed, in 2016, the player with the biggest worm at the end of the day was able to share a \"victory message\" with the world. On each server, leaderboards are displayed at the top right, showing the top ten players with worms that have the most mass out of all the other worms in the entire server.\r\n\r\nDownload all your favorites: diep io (diep.io), Zombs Royale (zombsroyale.io), Agario (agar.io), Slitherio (slither.io), Paper.io (paper.io) and tons more directly our Windows Store!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NJXCDL6Z7B5","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Fancy Fashion Salon","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21027.13672390224487778.108bd76f-9525-4636-9721-1d9358fb7e79.ebd9a45c-a8d7-4418-bd0d-b9c2ae513189","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36386.13672390224487778.f15966d4-c288-4dd0-a6d7-2dd430e86523.f7301b88-5de7-42fb-991b-0a0ba3f0c2a5","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["53001.FancyFashionSalon_zca8h67ayrj6t"],"ContentIds":["e5991dbb-056f-1eba-bb04-9637f5d3ddba"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This fashion doll is getting ready to go to the mall.

But it this was war, and the law of a good soldier was a lack of feeling.

Starting with Windows 98 other version of solitaire joined the suit - FreeCell, Spider, Tri-Peaks and Pyramid. As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games. Use menu (top-tight corner) to change the game type, difficulty, check score, help or to start a new game.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMRLL","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Two players Checkers","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1239.9007199266460917.147c7107-8ced-47b5-9bc9-17f65a52d0e8.4978caf4-5c12-4781-acef-356378aa8859","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0E005B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["38594Msialk.TwoplayersCheckers_zwb35xexc50tj"],"ContentIds":["1f9edb02-774e-8ac2-596b-8e2c75d35e18"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Checkres (or Draughts) is a well-known game all over the word.\r\n\r\nThanks to this app you can play checkers with your friend whenever you want.

Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play.

system. One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved.
