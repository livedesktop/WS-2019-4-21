Like the other Match-3 games, you have to make groups of three out of the jellies which then dissolve, making room for new pieces. If you're lucky, the new pieces match the existing ones, setting off a chain reaction and suddenly racking up your points. If you combine more than three jellies of the same colour, they leave behind a bonus block that makes a whole row or colour vanish in seconds. And the clock that loads extra time onto the timer ticking away on every level is just as useful. Don't let the timer run out!

Race to the top of the board by riding on your luck! Test your luck against friends and family. If you find no one else, test your luck against android!!\r\n\r\nTrivia:\r\nSnakes and Ladders, known as Moksha Patam, originated in ancient India as part of a family of dice board games and made its way to England and was known as \"Snakes and Ladders\", then the basic concept was introduced in the United States as Chutes and Ladders. The game was popular in ancient India and emphasized the role of fate or karma.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\nEach player starts in an imaginary space below square marked as '1' and takes turn to roll single die and move their corresponding game piece by the number rolled on the die. Game pieces follow a fixed route which is marked by a plough track from the bottom to the top of the game board. If on completion of steps marked by number rolled on die the player lands on lower numbered end of a ladder, the player moves to the higher end of the ladder. Similarly, if the player lands on higher numbered end of snake, he must move to the lower end of the snake. The player that reaches to the last square of the board first is the winner!\r\n\r\nWe provide you following options to change rules to allow you greater control:\r\n* Start game only when 6 is rolled - This adds a bit of challenge as you (and android in case of single player) need to roll 6 before you can move your game piece.\r\n* Land exactly on 100 to win - If you are up to a bigger challenge, set this option for greater thrill. If this rule is enabled, then you (and android in case of single player) need to land exactly on 100 in order to win. If you roll die such that you go beyond hundred, then your game piece will not move. You can still get another turn if you rolled six, even though your piece will not move.\r\n* End game when any one player wins - When playing in 3 or 4 players mode, enabling this option will ensure that the game ends as soon as any one player wins. It shortens the game, but you'll miss out on fun of finding out who came second or third!!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGXZKW8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Prime World: Defenders","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47406.13510798883898729.8ea4645b-ccf6-41de-a89b-f152a2b6f158.fdfd0e93-48bb-42d1-bca3-0c916877ffdc","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63910.13510798883898729.2ed9f228-15f9-41dc-bcbd-dbb90bc44d2e.94f76f23-72e3-41ed-8546-13575ab86213","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3540.13510798883898729.b472fa93-7419-41af-8020-8c9e7dc233bc.16145909-8767-4e44-bfa8-124115480b56","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36516.13510798883898729.278dbda5-510a-4114-8643-3098acfa5b8e.4a81762a-4a6b-4a5d-bcc3-26d192e2586a","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8207.13510798883898729.8d97dffa-636e-4a94-892f-2ddb0eda7a32.f802b410-d3e8-4006-b7f8-3bbe3cfa4d3d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15404.13510798883898729.8544c4c1-e8dd-441f-9785-3f9c54b2f29d.e0c2341a-df70-4351-b477-bc68376c973d","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35032.13510798883898729.74d2b23f-d9d7-42d1-bd2f-8d55ad267ec0.027a90df-c69e-4dcf-8ee3-11925e74959f","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36178.13510798883898729.0767d6ba-6e0f-4b64-a8cd-8ba86affba70.b6292caf-99a1-463e-bb7a-48437d76f3b8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.1,"RatingsCount":"20","PackageFamilyNames":["4EA62672.PrimeWorldDefenders_twpb7cgm4b9wy"],"ContentIds":["6585f359-97f6-67bd-cb33-8e44bf8b070c","d3544611-35eb-7ae1-a499-ae61936c69bc","3bc220d4-f955-4aab-a546-f639f723adc2"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"“The graphics are fantastic and the few changes in an established formula makes for a great little game” - tech-tongue.com\r\n\r\n“Getting strong towers and magic and using them intelligently is a lot of fun, especially since there’s no arbitrary energy to limit how much you can play” - TechnologyTell.com\r\n\r\n“Go check it out, defenders” - Droid-Life.com\r\n\r\nEnter the Prime’s World Universe and destroy countless enemies with towers and magic.

Every Kakuro game can be solved through logic alone. \r\n\r\nAll puzzles have been tested and have a solution - if you get stuck in any particular board and think there is no solution, reset the board and start over. You will manage to find the correct solution if you open your mind and explore different paths.\r\n\r\nReal Kakuro puzzle is a very elegant game, providing fabulous gameplay experience with 2000 unique games in 5 different difficulty levels. Can you solve them all?\r\n\r\n• Clean board, providing hours of pleasure gameplay.\r\n• Handmade unique challenging games.

The trick is won by the highest trump in it - or if it contains no trump, by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next.\r\n\r\nWhen all 13 tricks have been played, the side which won more tricks scores 1 point for each trick they won in excess of 6.

The idea is to beat the house by netting as close to twenty-one as possible. If you’ve never played before it seems a lot easier  than it actually is, so don’t get too cocky. The dealer will continue to hand out cards until you bust by getting a total well over twenty-one, or until you tell them to stop. To win, you must be closer to twenty-one than the house, otherwise known as the dealer. Place a bet before every hand, and if you win you’ll increase your earnings. Don’t raise your bet too high though or you will lose all of your cash if the house beats you! The beauty of this online card game is that......you don’t have to visit a casino to play, and you don’t have to lose real money. Heck, you don’t even have to leave your house to get in on the action! Just pull up a chair, plop yourself down and start tossing money onto the table. Keep a close eye on your cards though, you don’t want to bust and lose what you’ve put down. Well, what are you waiting for? Get in there and place some bets! Challenge your friends and family and compete to see who can make the most money in Blackjack. How much will you make? Will you become a Blackjack millionaire? There’s only one way to find out.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGZQT3J","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Pirate Escape","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.46048.13510798883354185.6f07d375-9c16-4a7c-be9b-9631803f084f.2ad20f52-44cc-4bbb-b134-5465fa404845","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.33956.13510798883354185.51848e8e-e235-4a9a-9eb2-46933828ba7a.08fe8d28-8e49-460b-af2f-2383543be1c2","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.539.13510798883354185.3180aa36-d844-4a73-83c8-6221327ea041.17769d69-aed2-4490-8c82-5ea1d2f57587","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46542.13510798883354185.a884dedb-88f1-46b8-a191-2a1ac6ffdec6.e2040677-20b9-4c41-99c6-d664b0463be6","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63666.13510798883354185.e5466863-b1de-49fd-a4cd-8ecce305f5d6.ab1f1a4d-e41a-45d9-85e4-4e60940d2815","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7304.13510798883354185.52f87aa0-d4d7-4eef-a8e6-c8d67e7bae19.e6a61306-54b7-4b83-b91e-3c1fbb55cd94","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.7101.13510798883354185.084a60c3-289c-448d-bd4a-075391c31bfc.db66760c-61b8-4bb7-a10a-13a313e139c6","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61063.13510798883354185.81022e45-91f9-40e0-8a0f-d454c5d32bf3.e825d87c-f0fd-4abe-b29d-1cb56515dbf8","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31164.13510798883354185.a15b8cbf-96c4-4fb4-bb11-b771df1b6cd9.180c0d82-606e-417c-92ca-51c6d2371ea8","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.29283.13510798883354185.f36f8d1c-0aa7-4f27-8423-e74512a10a73.c390a7b6-70ad-461a-ab7d-407da4ceb916","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["Trapped.PirateEscape_bhn6e84ggqs1p"],"ContentIds":["45e50228-8b2d-6f94-1aff-bca9b190b15d","5f33a883-4ba4-14b7-bf6f-45ed77adea1f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Ahoy, captain!\r\nWe’ve been plundering these seas for ten years, being the most successful crew in the Caribbean.

This game comes from Ancient Egypt.\r\n\r\nGoal:\r\n\r\nMove all the cards to the Foundation (upper right). When the 'Easy' option is on, you only have to move all the cards on the table (tableau or pyramid) to win.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n\r\nYou can move cards to the Foundation by Double-Tap or dropping a card on another, exposed, card. If the ranks combine to 13, both cards will move to the Foundation. Kings, being rank 13, move to the Foundation immediately upon being touched.\r\n\r\nIf you like to relax with solitaire or puzzle games then we think you'll love Pyramid Solitaire*.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to remove pairs of cards that add up to the total of the highest card in the deck from an arrangement of cards - a pyramid of 28 cards.\r\n\r\nWhen using the common French deck, Jacks value at 11, Queens 12, and Kings 13. So the highest value is 13. In the numbered Spanish deck the highest numbers are also the Kings at 12, so the pairs must add up to 12.\r\n\r\nTo set up the pyramid, deal one card face up at the top of the playing area, then two cards beneath and partially covering it, then three beneath them, and so on till you have dealt out a row of seven cards for a total of 28 cards dealt. Refer to image.\r\n\r\nThe remaining cards are placed to the side face down. This is the Stock.\r\n\r\nTo play, pairs of exposed cards can be removed to the Foundation if their values total 13 (12 if using the Spanish deck). Thus, kings can be removed immediately to the Foundation. Cards must not be covered. Thus when an Ace rests on a Queen, that Queen can not be removed.\r\n\r\nYou may draw cards from the Stock one at a time and match it with any exposed card. if no match is made the drawn Stock card is still discarded into the Foundation.\r\n\r\nOnce the Stock is exhausted and/or no more pairs can be made, the game ends.\r\n\r\nTo score, count the number of remaining face up cards in the pyramid. A perfect score is therefore zero, where all cards have been matched into the Foundation.\r\n\r\nConditions for winning\r\n\r\nTo be considered won, all cards (cards from the pyramid and cards from the stock) must be moved to the foundation; the game cannot be won if at least two cards cannot be moved from the stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariations\r\n\r\n-Relaxed Pyramid Solitaire: to be considered won, all cards from the pyramid must be moved to the foundation; the game can still be won with cards left in the stock.\r\n-Redeals may or may not be allowed.\r\nThree cards at a time from the stack, repeating until no matches can be made; placing all -cards totalling 13 in a stack.\r\n-Alternatively, seven cards are dealt below the pyramid. These cards can match each other exposed cards in the pyramid or from the stack.\r\n-Another addition is playing Pyramid Solitaire with a cell, filled either from the tableau or from the waste upcard.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n+ addictive gameplay\r\n+ enchanting graphics set in Ancient Egypt\r\n+ simple controls, easy to learn\r\n+ atmospheric sound effects\r\n+ a well made free solitaire game!\r\n+ Unlimited Undo \r\n+ Detailed Statistics","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1NSR4","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Aces FreeCell Solitaire","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47545.13510798885966401.8d8ba2a7-9a83-4e88-a03b-58cac69ab242.57e224ec-a50a-4579-bcf6-41fd5d6bad7d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#4a6ad5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30659.13510798885966401.3b62b551-ed5f-4fe5-b8ef-511c8e21028b.d387c0b2-f96d-415c-9dd3-da41517994d1","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#4a6ad5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"12","PackageFamilyNames":["26701Win8PokerCardGames.AcesFreeCellSolitaire_fdae3654gze3y"],"ContentIds":["dc133739-cddb-6d51-4f88-851789f5c2d0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FreeCell is a solitaire-based card game played with a 52-card standard deck. It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1NTVK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Play Football kicks","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59551.13510798885969526.51e4bebb-30ee-4ce9-81c8-8a9f10990672.ae99d5d1-0d8d-45c7-bf5d-1f7c567eb440","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2103.13510798885969526.078f8451-9362-4c11-9f54-7591a6e86702.48188406-a542-4aa5-8c46-b6eb83fee3f2","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.8,"RatingsCount":"6","PackageFamilyNames":["50154AVLogix.PlayFootballkicks_q7ke2emr2nmbw"],"ContentIds":["387f2144-2bfd-7800-9b66-848bbf35a751","4ad21b1b-3ac2-f886-29f6-0d585ca54efc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Soccer is an ancient game which were started over hundred years ago.

For those that want a puzzle that lasts more than a few minutes. And now an unlimited supply of automatically generated 9 x 9 Sudokus for when you want a quick puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe Samurai and Super Sudokus come in three levels of difficulty, none of them are trivial or easy.  These are Sudoku that will take a bit of time to solve.  And if you complete one you will have solved it.  There are no cheats or hints to allow you to carry on if you get stuck. The 9x9 Sudoku come in four levels of difficulty with the most difficult requiring slightly harder solving techniques than the larger puzzles.\r\n\r\nThere are aids to help with some of the legwork though, the Sudoku will auto fill and update pencil marks showing all of the possible numbers available in each square and you can highlight all squares that can hold a possible number allowing patterns to be seen.  But, there is nothing in the Sudoku to shortcut the mental process required to complete it.\r\n\r\nThe list of Sudoku now shows whether automatic pencil marks or number highlighting have been used and the best time for each Sudoku will reflect this, if you complete a Sudoku without using assistance this will be recorded as your best even if it was slower than a previous attempt where assistance was used.\r\n\r\nThe Sudoku auto save so you can have several on the go at any time.\r\n\r\nAlso for traditionalists or the masochistic you can email a Sudoku to your computer to be printed out and solved the hard way with no highlighting assistance using a pen and paper.\r\n\r\nBecause of the size of the Sudoku this app will work best on a PC, tablet  or large screen phone.  However, the grid can be zoomed so play on almost any device should be possible with a pit of patience.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1R48S","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dress Up: Royal Wedding","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35989.13510798886153975.b7e33b4b-0909-46e8-9fe7-66e72468b4f8.f357466e-78ba-4311-a97a-f872d0cbb709","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38310.13510798886153975.5da7025d-6a17-48fa-a31f-0f5affcdf61f.4f0405f4-3e4c-4777-98eb-224776d3d45d","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25518.13510798886153975.6f06aeed-07e8-4f97-a9ed-56e433b450b1.6fe0b81a-0043-46d0-9806-f2a50f0e17fc","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24596.13510798886153975.e33d89b1-aeea-4bfb-af17-422ae04826bf.35046096-542b-4f93-84c6-cd185e7798d3","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37096.13510798886153975.1d5c96b7-d535-4dca-9603-534cc6d8ae50.1a05df8e-cdb4-42f6-8b31-6d9f72b69464","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["29654uslight.DressUpRoyalWedding_j11n5d0xh9kme"],"ContentIds":["f1c396ae-1e7f-1d8b-e226-6189f0e17b08","9f03adcf-4612-3cde-61e0-da14e1afce6c","542c235e-be0f-8e17-5396-7021b2042341"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This is a free game for girls.
