If kid is interested more in some types of games, he/she can skip the ones he/she doesn't want.\r\n\r\nTo keep kids challenged, points are awarded for each game stage completed. A scoreboard is maintained which kid can see after each game. When kid scores enough points, he/she earns a sticker of his/her choice. All his/her earned stickers are kept in a box which he/she can relish any time they want later.\r\n\r\nWe have put our every effort to make this app interesting and beautiful.

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NM6RM10KV2S","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Snail Bob 5","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25403.13697876011905715.92802071-39d4-4d83-8b1e-8da2f2df341b.105490a5-4389-47c0-baeb-4235210ee46f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32982.13697876011905715.92802071-39d4-4d83-8b1e-8da2f2df341b.9d211dfe-054e-4262-a47f-8c1dd55682d2","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["39135goatgame.SnailBob5_p6fh3swgmjcvc"],"ContentIds":["1bf3ac05-e6c0-b803-daaa-0bcf081ead4b","b277506b-d601-8a6f-4478-6d8a0d08e800"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"In the previous episodes you were helping the brave Snail Bob to reach his new house.

years who learn how to read in English. \r\n\r\nThe evil Snow Queen has frozen the letters of the English alphabet and the poor animals were taken into the icy captivity. Only your smart kid can save the animals. In order to do that your child has to learn English letters and combine them into words, which represent the names of the captured animals. \r\n\r\nIt’s not a big secret that many kids can face difficulties learning to read in English, because English letters in real words have different pronunciation rules in comparison with their sounds in the English alphabet. \r\n\r\n“Learn to Read & Save the Animals” educational game offers efficient Phonics techniques in order to learn how to read in English. During the process of playing the educational game the children will hear the sound of each English letter in exactly the same way as it’s pronounced in the shown word. \r\n\r\nIt allows your child to understand the rules of English word reading on the subconscious level. Kid will simply feel how to pronounce the English words, without suffering and trying to find the transcription of the word in thick English dictionaries.\r\n\r\nThe game offers 3 educational levels free of charge. The full version contains the total of 16 educational levels allocated by the level of complexity. Words of the very first level contain just 2 or letters, while the words of the last level may have up to 7 or even 8 letters.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MW5TQ6NN3Z2","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Nightly T-REX","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51172.13845329790394035.090479b1-1937-4f37-ad1d-ab3de16e3de0.c57d687b-e284-409d-a330-793b2f02b7f3","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"black","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60828.13845329790394035.0d32a58e-f1fb-4d0e-b588-080f64995c0f.8903899e-e247-494a-a3d9-4911487e9984","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"black","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52437.13845329790394035.602842d3-56ef-4848-b08f-db7d9a9840a0.a0908d08-5db6-4f87-a8d2-dc88663ae192","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"black","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12771.13845329790394035.e86f8081-f613-41e0-92d8-28883f4cf71f.88f4ca9d-46ca-416a-8c40-9c5aaaffdb54","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"black","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["33365TheSofwareMafia.NightlyT-REX_d32ttj2wtfjpt"],"ContentIds":["90e64e40-0581-fe6a-e644-a7aea8ec758b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Nightly T-REX, is just an other \"jumping T-REX\" that escaped Google Chrome's NetError page.

This is the most complete and realistic RC simulator available!\r\n\r\nNote: we are constantly adding more, you will see them listed when you install the program!\r\n\r\nThe program includes different flying fields, boat and car race tracks.\r\n\r\nWe also includes 3 interactive object sets that can be loaded on any flying field. The interactive objects can be used for learning landing and precise model control. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the fixed point camera that represents the RC pilot point of view, we have included follow up camera that allows for walking behind the model. That is useful when you just start, so the model never gets away. \r\n\r\nPlease try our full featured professional RC flight simulator ClearView for PC here: http://rcflightsim.com - see the video of ClearView bellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n1. This is not a game. You are controlling flying rc models that reacts like real flying models. It takes some time to learn, and again, do not expect \"arcade\" style controls. \r\n2. The onscreen control sticks are just indicators! They are made small so they do not obscure the screen. \r\n\r\n*** You do not need to keep your fingers on them *** \r\n\r\nSliding your finger any where on the right screen half affects the right control stick , the same for the left screen part - sliding finger there moves the left control stick. \r\n\r\nWe suggest to select beginner settings at first few days before you can comfortably progress further.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Starting with Windows 98 other version of solitaire joined the suit - FreeCell, Spider, Tri-Peaks and Pyramid. As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices.
