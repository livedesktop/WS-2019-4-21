Beautiful flowers make them feel the joys of spring, and the painting process turns into an enthralling game where they can bring their fantasies to life and draw a red daffodil, or a blue sunflower.\r\n\r\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\r\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

The 28 domino tiles are shuffled face down and form the stock or boneyard. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge before the players, so that each player can see his own domino tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay. One player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. In different games first tiles are also different. In Muggins player should start with the highest double (6-6), in Bergen the first move should be 0-0, in Mexican train each round starts with the next lower double. This tile starts the line of play, a series of tiles in which adjacent tiles touch with matching, i.e. equal, values. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.\r\n- Scoring game\r\nPlayers accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. In Muggins (All fives) player must make the open ends of the layout add up to 5s or a multiple of five (5s, 10, 15, 20, etc.) In bergen player scores when numbers on the open ends are equal. If a player does not call \"domino\" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says 'domino' after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino. In Mexican train the double zero domino is scored as 50 points.\r\n- Draw game\r\nIn a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile. The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock. The Draw game is often referred to as simply \"dominos\".\r\n\r\nIf you like board games like Checkers, Mahjong, Backgammon and Chess, you will love Dominoes: Best Classic Dominoes Board

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDR6NX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Klondike Solitaire HD Free","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8273.9007199266553491.5213e8dc-8f60-4d24-86cd-cbc645190bbd.0d82715b-b8bb-4943-bf84-84e460af9623","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#187818","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16933.9007199266553491.9b199ffb-4479-43dc-ae3e-5d51be9f7a09.adb4033d-2f2c-4812-81ec-5d2be2011a72","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#187818","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39236.9007199266553491.1fa2aab0-076b-4882-a7dd-a9855015965a.3391b494-3213-48c7-bf87-b492c040eb9b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#187818","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2305.9007199266553491.05766a6c-abd5-422d-8910-36c285a47f58.ad1e19be-882b-4a37-886c-0b68714033e3","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#187818","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40477.9007199266553491.8b487322-b8dd-4164-b2da-134e1432c6bd.0403f145-cf69-4cf4-813a-22d684b46656","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#187818","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64635.9007199266553491.f47a63d5-7c21-40f9-ac12-53d12e9db545.66cbce72-1cf5-4555-b50b-9c1f8fbbcddf","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#187818","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.6,"RatingsCount":"27","PackageFamilyNames":["60AC5286.KlondikeSolitaireHD_ynqp2pc461sw0"],"ContentIds":["9989f8d1-ad84-7ab1-27b9-a393dbc817de","c099c3af-a3fa-b47e-36fc-bf9e9c647331","981ec679-3177-d8c2-fec4-256f9ca3398b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Klondike Solitaire HD is a fun and addictive solitaire card game.

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJXX3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Gin Rummy","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56627.9007199266268812.7ec7585a-7392-41ae-933a-1f41b24eb02e.2e0359c5-decc-4b23-b7f5-c91bf3cce753","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55528.9007199266268812.672e78dc-2846-42c5-9e1e-a4695bdb4aac.29d7a224-52e3-4ec3-b10c-b3dff3a32ecc","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53341.9007199266268812.85fa5bc0-8c7f-4301-bebe-e8a21642d275.8e80000e-0f64-4f42-b80c-6b8d84ccd646","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20817.9007199266268812.a55023fe-387d-436b-a6c8-58461bb953b0.e1cb00f4-8204-470b-bb45-6c629460009f","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19421.9007199266268812.92234dbe-01bf-4b9e-98e6-11ba5dc3be3e.3a447ec7-62f3-4cbc-8546-da5a2a7d048e","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45538.9007199266268812.0e4ff604-e334-4e97-bcbe-0c4749aac32f.450a42a3-28d2-4ce0-a944-59f6b5ab1973","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51125.9007199266268812.e7de3d82-f880-45ec-b998-2664a98129fd.649e4982-fe59-4c28-8d0a-5f12d446534b","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23391.9007199266268812.a304978c-d8ed-4c37-af56-f7b0633b5032.14733c22-dbad-431d-94b9-cf5e6eb07a9d","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55125.9007199266268812.e969e9b2-e6e2-4f23-b749-223e7dd49dad.dfbe936c-1561-490c-947c-6b1519db12a6","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53341.9007199266268812.85fa5bc0-8c7f-4301-bebe-e8a21642d275.8e80000e-0f64-4f42-b80c-6b8d84ccd646","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.8,"RatingsCount":"101","PackageFamilyNames":["TrivialTechnology.GinRummyFree_0ynvawc60ma20"],"ContentIds":["a99756f4-54ef-0f50-8a46-359b69a5ef4f","6195c7da-f9d3-8834-8ee8-3526c8ed00a7"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Gin Rummy, the classic two-player card game you know and love!

It is one of the best known board games of all-time.\r\n\r\nThe classic fast-trading property game features tokens from the 1930s all the way to the 2000s, with a beautiful game board and cards, the game takes you back to when it all began, but you still have to build your houses and hotels and see if you can bankrupt everyone else. The jet-set gameplay will be epic as you race around the world to visit the world’s most exciting places and buy locations.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is also known popularly called Business Board Game, The Landlord's Game and Finance\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a great game for 2 - 6 players. It is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and develop them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nMoney can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.\r\n\r\nPlay against the computer, against your friends in Local mode or with Thousands of Onopoly players around the world in Online Multiplayer Mode.\r\n\r\nYou can also create Private Rooms and invite your friends to play in Play with Friends Mode.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a simple game: you start off with some money, and your goal is to be the last player standing with money. The way you win in Monopoly is by collecting rents on property, or cash flow.\r\n\r\nOnopoly brilliantly combines both strategy and chance. It gets stressful and exciting, especially when things get closer to the endgame. \r\n\r\nYou better keep an eye on your money, because you never know when the dice will land you with a massive rent bill to pay. Sometimes staying in jail can be the safest place to be, but only after your properties are primed to make you money.\r\n\r\nYou’ve got to buy, sell and negotiate to win. Everyone loves the timeless game-play of Onopoly. \r\n\r\nTry to win the onopoly game by buying all the property and collecting as much money as possible. \r\nWill you be able to defeat your opponents? \r\n\r\nDownload Onopoly for free!!\r\n\r\n◆◆◆◆ Onopoly Features◆◆◆◆\r\n\r\n✔ Create Private Room and Invite Friends and Family\r\n✔ True multiplayer where you can play with real people online in online multiplayer mode.\r\n✔ Adaptable intelligence with smart AI when playing against computer\r\n✔ Play with players across the world\r\n✔ 2, 3,4,5 or 6 Player Mode \r\n✔ Play with Local Multiplayer\r\n \r\nPlease don't forget to Rate and Review Onopoly! \r\n\r\nYour Reviews Matter!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH3ZH4B","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Resident Evil 7 Teaser: Beginning Hour","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30630.13510798887946177.13700b82-eb3f-4d41-bb12-775896bfe309.d84641e0-512b-4f21-a40c-2894fdaf5e14","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"black","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59737.13510798887946177.f5d9e2ce-917b-49bc-9670-f40311c47f76.071cb0ca-89d0-411a-858d-0f8e25f76f45","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"black","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.836.13510798887946177.0ec90b85-44d2-4004-85d7-16f7ffe22996.d03d745a-cb0d-449d-9cf3-af8538c5388e","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"black","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1332.13510798887946177.f90ab70e-97cd-4527-a70c-d66bdec96a67.91d1a7a0-4993-4911-bc66-cd6de97e39ab","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"black","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63219.13510798887946177.ea9ab610-398d-4350-bbda-2d10359ea6b6.6c2831c4-1e29-4a29-80c4-f43813031eb3","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"black","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36662.13510798887946177.7700cfa1-b616-4dbd-b6e1-1a292246d89f.a507dc1b-7602-4eb6-aaca-35d5887fe312","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"black","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":2.6,"RatingsCount":"18","PackageFamilyNames":["F024294D.ResidentEvil7TeaserBeginningHour_8fty0by30jkny"],"ContentIds":["7a09a6f7-0e41-df4d-ff3c-6f3600bdb6f5"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"You wake up alone on the floor of an abandoned farmhouse.

The goal of the game is to take as many tricks as possible and reach a score of 10 or more first. The game is played in pairs. Your partner sits opposite to you and the deals are played clockwise. Each player is dealt five cards and the game starts by choosing a card suit.\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ advanced AI players\r\n✓ intuitive interface\r\n✓ balanced rules\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓\tIn the first round you can choose the trump suit by choosing the card from the center pile. \r\n✓\tIf the current round passes without choosing the trump a second one follows.\r\n✓\tIn the second round you must choose any suit of cards except the one you passed in the round before.\r\n✓\tIf the trump is not chosen in these 2 rounds the cards are reshuffled and the game starts again without changing the dealer.\r\n✓\tOnce a trump suit is chosen the game can start. \r\n✓\tIf you choose a trump suit in the first round, the card in the center pile is passed to the dealer of the cards.\r\n✓\tIf you are the dealer of the cards, your name is marked with an encircled D. If the trump is chosen in the first round you receive the trump card and must shed any card you wish.\r\n✓\tThe player next to the dealer in a clock-wise direction is the first to choose a trump suit. \r\n✓\tIf that player passes the chance, the next one after him follows.\r\n✓\tThe game is played between two teams: a top-bottom team comprised of you and a computer player and a left-right team of computer players.\r\n✓\tThe player and his partner are called the makers if one of them chooses a trump suit. Otherwise they are called the defenders.\r\n✓\tTo win the makers must take at least 3 tricks. The defenders in order to win must take at least 3 tricks as well.\r\n✓\tIf the makers take 5 tricks they score 2 points. If the defenders take 3 or more tricks they score 2 points.\r\n✓\tIf the makers take 3 or 4 tricks they score 1 point.

Otherwise if the team takes 3 or 4 tricks it scores only 1 point.\r\n✓\tThere is a specific order of the trump cards. The trump Jack is the most valuable card, followed by the Jack of the same-color suit. \r\n✓\tFor example if the trump suit is hearts, the most valuable card is the Jack of hearts followed by the Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓\tThese cards are followed by the Ace, the King, the Queen, the 10 and the 9. \r\n✓\tThere are only 24 cards in the deck - 6 from each suit.\r\n✓\tThe order of the cards in the other suits is the Ace, the King, the Queen, the Jack, the 10 and the 9.\r\n✓\tThe Jack of the same color as the trump suit makes part of the trump suit.\r\n✓\tYou can start the trick with any card but you must follow suit or play any other card if you cannot follow suit.\r\n✓\tThe trick is won by the player who plays the highest trump or the highest card of the starting suit.\r\n✓\tTo win the game you must be the first to score 10 or more points.\r\n✓\tThere is a statistics menu in which you can view the total games played, the percentage of won games, the number of rounds played, the number of euchres made.\r\n✓\tIf you as a defender take 3 or more tricks then you achieve a euchre.\r\n✓\tIf you as a maker take less than 3 tricks then you have been euchred.\r\n✓\tThe makers are marked with an M. The player that chose the trump is marked with a bold M.\r\n✓\tThe defenders are marked with a D.\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

The new versions of the game are much brighter and diverse. Retris is one of the best in our opinion, although one can find dozens of Bricks, Blocks, Pentomino and 1010!-like games in the Internet. But it is still essentially the same game that was originally Quadris (classic puzzle Tetris).\r\n\r\nYou can choose number of figures – 9 as in the classical version; 11 – a mix of three and four bricks; Pentax, 17 – all the figures. You can moderate type of figure movement (fluent/intermittent), initial speed, figure colors (as in Tetcolor). At the same time there are no frills, and classic Tetris and Tetcolor lovers might grow fond of it.\r\n\r\nRetris has two color modes: in the first one all pieces of a certain type consist of blocks of the same color. The bottom part that is not burned is composed of disparate units if mixed colors - the remnants of the thrown shapes.\r\n\r\nThe second mode is when a falling figure is composed of red blocks, and the bottom blocks (made of the fallen ones)  are blue.\r\n\r\nRetris provides an opportunity to show a transparent grid that divides a figure into blocks.\r\n\r\nThe game can show a “phantom” – an identical “twin” of a falling figure to help you see where it is better to place it.\r\n\r\nOne can choose a mode of control type in Quadris: if you prefer to play holding your smartphone or tablet with two hands, you can select a mode in which the control buttons are situated to the left and to the right from the game field.\r\n\r\nThere is also an option \"play with one hand\" in Quadris, the control buttons are placed to the right from the playing field on your smartphone or tablet screen.\r\n\r\nYou can compete with other players as in many other puzzle games. It is possible to play anonymously or to register and get your unique nickname. After that your results get into the global chart.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the auto-save function if your game is interrupted by a call or any other program switch on the smartphone!\r\n\r\nHow to play:\r\n- Create horizontal lines using the falling blocks;\r\n- When you make a line of blocks, it is cleared from the screen;\r\n- The game is over when the blocks pile up and reach the top of the screen;\r\n- You get more points for completing multiple lines at once.\r\n\r\nYou can play the new version of Quadris either online and offline. The game may be of interest both to adult fans of the classic Tetris game and to attract the younger generation, it is as easy to use as educational online games.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of classic puzzle games – Tetris and other related puzzle games like Quadris, Pentax, etc. – has been repeatedly studied by scientists. If one believes their opinion, downloading a free puzzle game (like Quadris or Tetris), you get both a free shrink and a free nutritionist – it is believed that classic puzzle and logic games may relieve stress, may help to ease one’s condition after psychological problems and may reduce the risk of overeating by switching attention to the game. As opposed to the \"shooters\", Quadris and other classic puzzles can calm, giving a feeling that you put your life in order and under control along with the blocks on the playing

It was a terrible thing that happened in Heather’s family 20 years ago. Everyone was left frantic after Heather’s sister suddenly disappeared. They started a serious investigation, looking for the young girl everywhere but it seemed that all efforts were meaningless since there wasn’t a single trace that could lead them to a certain answer of the whole situation. That’s why the police and the authorities kept the case as open but they actually gave up from it.\r\n\r\nHeather’s family is desperate all those years but they hope that one day things will change and they will see their other daughter once again. Heather on the other hand, has some strange intuition that tells her that her sister could be still alive. However, she also didn’t find any reliable trace about that, or at least until now where things started moving on all of a sudden.\r\n\r\nHeather arrives in one small city in the south part of the land. The reason for her being there is the anonymous telephone call that got last night. According that call, the answer of her big dilemma lies exactly here. Heather is looking for her younger sister for so many years. The young girl was kidnapped and from then on, no one knows anything about her. Heather didn’t like to quit all those years and even after 20 years she is prepared to take a detailed investigation, hoping that this time the mystery will be solved once for all. And since this is a rather complicated case, this game will last longer than usual. You will meet many different characters but also a bonus game, Mahjong.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH34B0T","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Order & Chaos 2","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12681.13510798885037718.036448c0-005d-4535-b1d7-1c9c2873e77c.943f2619-2966-4482-b908-1c8cd0be1926","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#094AB2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48214.13510798885037718.f04a6ba6-675a-426f-8b98-8f5abc8ad9a6.fdfab6aa-00f5-47b5-aaf6-4125a780a2fe","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#094AB2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57849.13510798885037718.25108d1e-1da6-4a6e-98be-c1b15facaa1d.88382c17-6003-4a22-b265-6cba733b7df5","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#094AB2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22889.13510798885037718.08fb39c8-85d0-42d3-b1f4-fd174307234d.75a5b72b-81f2-4cf2-b34f-14adb8918afa","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#094AB2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64776.13510798885037718.d13c42d7-a65a-4952-bdf9-d255b6f6bee7.0d5adc20-d150-4eba-9bd9-bf4968c2011e","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.8,"RatingsCount":"192","PackageFamilyNames":["A278AB0D.OrderChaos2_h6adky7gbf63m"],"ContentIds":["e9a436df-4dc3-69f3-d3d1-da0ee517d9ef"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Be reborn in the best and biggest mobile MMORPG!\r\n\r\nGet on the road to redemption in a completely new story in the world of Order & Chaos.

He must play either the next card in sequential order or a wild '*' card, using either cards in hand, the top card of his stock pile, or the top card of any of his four discard piles. If the player can play all five cards from hand, he draws five more and continues playing. When no more plays are available, the player discards one card to either an empty discard pile or on top of an existing one and play passes to the next player. When a build pile reaches 12, it is removed from the board and that space becomes empty for another pile to be started; play continues until one player has played his final start card.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4R45C","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Gunship Battle Strike 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13834.13510798887410238.8760650c-a070-43b5-954e-68962b85fdc0.d684fe8f-5e27-4e6f-8831-6ba7defb3c25","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40472.13510798887410238.71ecac3f-f285-402b-b9af-234d2a588e5a.412de4e4-5f46-4e84-8239-b81e16b0351b","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20032.13510798887410238.36e55578-3c1f-4b1a-9705-76bc6dca8367.451e6cf3-1828-45b2-bc27-1411c2b7a922","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":2.2,"RatingsCount":"4","PackageFamilyNames":["34335TopiTapiGames.GunshipBattleStrike3D_wa68eadphfe3r"],"ContentIds":["5e79e35e-5c3b-cab6-9b63-47a7dbb42453","52452535-937e-8448-ca5e-aef9680b0f51"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Commodore!! we have detected an knownGunship Battle Strike 3D in deep Seas with our Satellite.\r\nAccording to our visuals the ship doesn't have any flag nor have any kind of symbol which represent the carrier. \r\nWe have decided in our meeting that we would first check the ship carrier; if some one resist we will take it by force. \r\nYour Mission:\r\n- Go check the ship existence.\r\n- Eliminate all the resistance. \r\n- For this mission you have air support with only one gunship helicopter with limited weapons. \r\n- The weather is bad, time is short, Go make a strategy and eliminate the resistance. \r\n- Your mission code is \"Black Hawk\".\r\n- Good Luck Commodore!!\r\n\r\nHow to Play:\r\n- Touch & Drag the screen anywhere to move/rotate your gun left, right, up or down \r\n- Aim and tap Fire button at bottom right to fire.\r\n- For clear aim view use the Telescope for sniper target shot\r\n- Try to shoot and kill enemy soldiers on first spot\r\n- The weapons will reload itself and you have unlimited number of bullets\r\nHow to Play Via PC::\r\n- Use left mouse button to fire\r\n- Use Right mouse button for zooming the aim \r\n- Reload Gun with R key","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NCMWZW7FTS1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Romance with Chocolate - Hidden Objects Love Story .

Score strikes, spares, and turkeys.\r\n\r\nPICK UP SPARES\r\n\r\nPractice challenging spares. Clear stages to unlock new balls.\r\n\r\nONE HUNDRED PINS\r\n\r\nKnock down as many pins as you can in 5 throws at a rack of 100 pins!\r\n\r\nCANDLEPIN BOWLING\r\n\r\nInvented in 1880. Candlepin bowling offers a great challenge. Candlepins are thin skittles that bounce and spin unpredictably when struck. Pins aren't cleared between rounds allowing you to knock them into still upright pins.\r\n\r\nFIVE PIN BOWLING\r\n\r\n Invented in 1904 in Canada. In 5 pin, each pin is worth different point values. Spares are strategic attempts to hit the most valuable pins. A perfect game is 450 points!\r\n\r\nNINE PIN (GERMAN BOWLING)\r\n\r\nInvented in medieval Germany, 9 pin is what most later bowling games are based on. Nine pins are arranged in a diamond shape with a \"kingpin\" in the middle. Knocking all the pins over earns 9 points. Knocking all the pins over but the kingpin earns 12!\r\n\r\nLONG ALLEY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nKnock over pins by throwing a barrel-shaped 'cheese'! To score points, you first have to knock over the kingpin. It's tricky to master when the ball bounces unpredictably!\r\n\r\nDUCK PIN\r\n\r\nInvented in 1904 in New England. Duck pin uses the nearly the same rules as 10 pin, but allows 3 rounds to knock over all the pins. The ball and pins are smaller making precision very important to score well!\r\n\r\nIRON PIN\r\n\r\nIron pin is the same as normal bowling but one random pin is much heavier than the others. Careful consideration has to be made on how to knock over the heavy pin while also clearing the normal ones.\r\n\r\nSHUFFLE BOWLING\r\n\r\nBowling on a shuffleboard table! Knock over the pins with a weighted puck.\r\n\r\nWEST COUNTY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nTraditional skittles game that has been played in British pubs for centuries.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Bowling has an option to purchase Candlepin, Duck Pin, Five Pin, Nine Pin, 100 pin, and Iron Pin variants. Ten pin, and spares mode are included free.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJBW8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Lost Souls: Enchanted Paintings","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.6309.9007199266251245.beb45ee1-2834-4f81-a6cf-9f1280c13056.02d13aae-b7bb-4875-ba75-a04e8d19ce53","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.30958.9007199266251245.e3370cea-03cb-48d7-87c0-50c598409233.8f0cb1ea-6178-4e0c-8d5c-0ec3004c8641","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.43528.9007199266251245.5d65ad2e-9b29-4db1-8001-12f6a3f3532f.fb01096f-4dfa-4b94-8630-964751f57a4f","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.12034.9007199266251245.a7b1b0e1-7a7f-4ebf-844f-572f50bc78f6.719c8bf9-330b-4465-ae5a-aaeb05e315b1","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.30068.9007199266251245.1fcb9a4a-f722-4964-af2f-2ef8b8e33fae.60955710-0583-4f45-a231-350814a5692b","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.48591.9007199266251245.e46da556-cd14-4f3f-8bfc-178f91fc22b4.c0575fbd-e3b1-452b-964a-e94617a3a532","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"257","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.LostSoulsEnchantedPaintings_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["8bbb7b2a-c1ce-0596-89ec-4c3581be864a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"When a mysterious painting of a spooky old castle appears on the doorstep of Bella’s house, her happy and peaceful life crumbles to dust.
