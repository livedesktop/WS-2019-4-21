A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MTZ208NTC7S","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"ER Doctor - Surgery Simulator Game for Kids","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54433.13803600884262889.f2a46c85-6941-4b98-9683-728b19b2ce07.88504c34-cc05-4b90-be76-6b0e946cbdc8","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#222C37","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1040.13803600884262889.6b992db9-7bba-48cf-83cc-f0d10e9314d5.fb499895-c9f8-4841-8f40-a0e187de1e96","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#222C37","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45458.13803600884262889.7d5b5528-3454-4082-8975-615a58e1790c.4db33a25-afec-4b35-becf-9b729da6ab2c","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#222C37","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32174.13803600884262889.221f7485-d496-4347-a6bc-55f187b8c5f6.cecc9310-cd10-4839-9153-1b98f0fff66a","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#222C37","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24797.13803600884262889.93cb8f69-77af-4c21-9eeb-ebc98b7617a2.863bf85a-0a48-44f4-bd34-18747b4765cd","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#222C37","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.142.13803600884262889.31cc98de-e5cb-4187-9a44-7fcb9b5500cf.7aa27f45-3f36-4c45-8e87-7beb1f5f1172","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#222C37","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32723.13803600884262889.4fdf3484-fbde-4555-8b6c-cbdcff843c2c.22025f29-8a97-4e47-a557-4c9988612aac","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#222C37","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59614.13803600884262889.1336582f-a1e9-475f-90c0-6f6c2b75c4d9.89cff8cb-a3c2-40c6-a998-fea0c474126f","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#222C37","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35496.13803600884262889.10c7f180-49cf-42e2-85c0-b4f3b4d8ff8e.b8d3c395-f106-45a7-9f81-d61af6441f84","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#222C37","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7999.13803600884262889.e6644165-a769-4405-a79a-67e4cee34df4.6a925ec1-549a-4049-b83f-dc5f5b43daae","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#222C37","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Feex⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["UnitMGames.ERDoctor-SurgerySimulatorGameforKids_tt48tp7szpztr"],"ContentIds":["87554084-0865-0693-e6c9-6002065d7e9c","00aab5e9-a347-7852-3eee-5dfd24717dba"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Welcome little ones!

In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference. Always try to smash rivals in the side of their vehicle or from the rear. Head-on collisions on the other hand should be avoided. Practice makes perfect!\r\n\r\nUpgrades:\r\nYou have various cars you can unlock. These all have the pros and cons. Be sure to upgrade your cars wisely as the various type of events require different cars. Use armor upgrades to strengthen your endurance; or engine upgrades to boost your speed. To get your upgrades you earn money during races. The better you perform the more you earn. Before a race you can also buy power-ups to boost your performance during a race. The nitro boost will allow you to accelerate super-fast and smash your opponents even harder; or choose one of the other power-ups such an armor booster to strengthen your car during the race. \r\n\r\nIf you like demolition games this game is made for you!\r\n3, 2, 1 start your download and join the ultimate demolition derby game experience now!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4RPZS","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Royal Trouble 2 HD","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54011.13510798887557277.e265af57-de6d-4e4b-989c-e21f1eae7b46.285f8a8c-7a8a-4fec-905f-c9f8bd7d8d52","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#1257ac","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51946.13510798887557277.1684d3e4-07cb-4d42-ac13-a65093eac271.d98195d0-ee11-4d73-8f1c-c8810146f255","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#1257ac","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22075.13510798887557277.a7514a1c-e972-4344-be2f-f030f7e2f28b.ae136bd4-af4f-4590-82cd-78fd32a3cf50","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#1257ac","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57397.13510798887557277.ddef2f6f-178f-42fe-abc1-c1d3f21b76ff.577756c3-cfaf-48c1-b5ed-87acff1f8e01","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1257ac","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43956.13510798887557277.b430f1fd-a242-4e36-8c95-508e16354a72.c81f4b77-0c8b-4ee2-a7a3-7636c4c67b09","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#1257ac","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2450.13510798887557277.a4bc040a-1e16-4f84-a65e-747bd5ba5157.aa248de7-8988-4cde-bc47-8b78f694fe15","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#1257ac","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55456.13510798887557277.cc80f322-0afa-4db3-a35a-52e2206e59fd.214cad97-c111-49a7-add1-4fa90fb3d58f","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1257ac","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38663.13510798887557277.aa8ca983-8586-4555-ac75-2eb0fccde783.f0dfd596-0abc-4222-baf2-958b16d726af","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#1257ac","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38546.13510798887557277.6a3cf016-a671-466b-aff2-665fd7938dd9.7129a824-785c-453a-8e69-0ba68fe66f68","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#1257ac","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Feex⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.RoyalTrouble2HD_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["7f8ca56d-acdc-11cf-5799-47c39f59fba2"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Help a newlywed royal couple in this hilarious sequel to Royal Trouble: Hidden Adventures!\r\nJust married!

On top of the downturned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most downturned pile, and downturned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card. The piles should look like the figure to the right.\r\n\r\nThe four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with 2 and ending with King, all of the same suit. Once this is accomplished, the goal is to move this to a foundation, where the player has previously placed the Ace of that suit. Once the player has done this, they will have \"finished\" that suit, the goal being, of course, to finish all suits, at which time the player would have won. There are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck:\r\n\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste, either allowing three passes through the deck or placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once, reversing the order of each group of three as the cards are dealt.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but only passing through the deck once.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste with no limit on passes through the deck, but allowing the player to switch once to a single pass through the deck one card at a time; after that single pass, however, the player cannot go back to turning three cards at a time and can turn over no more cards from the waste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P76X8TSGS6W","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Extreme Off-road 4x4 Driving","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17481.14609877077245816.2c8d0e3c-ec45-4f50-bf51-63801e0fbb03.0a0501d1-b3b8-4013-9804-d34b0b2b637f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30909.14609877077245816.41be1a38-12b8-4b0f-a9ca-27b904522179.ed835c69-6e11-4d90-b4c0-f5e7c4bdbf07","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19263.14609877077245816.a3684a23-a2c1-43aa-a909-75e63e689053.f73ea47e-1156-47e4-8837-b26e45949b9c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Feex","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["12705GameStone.ExtremeOff-road4x4Driving_xx7a0xg4kw6vg"],"ContentIds":["e8f8c323-f493-6576-38ec-0a8610987480","4430f5b8-c8e7-bec9-fb2f-9a1153afd963"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Extreme Off-road 4x4 Driving\r\n\r\nIt is time to go extreme 4x4x off road, what do you think?

This is a shortened version of the “Nature for Tots” app.\r\n \r\nTogether with your child, you can watch wonderful images of fruits and vegetables, all while learning their names!\r\n\r\nAfter the child has looked through all the flashcards, he or she can take a fun quiz to see how many of the words he or she knows. Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child's developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThis educational application contains full set of “Fruits” and “Vegetables” flashcards from the “Nature for Kids” application. In addition, it includes the clipped demo sets of the following groups of educational cards: “Berries”, “Flowers”, “Mushrooms”, “Nature” (sea, island, forest, river, mountain, etc.), “Seasons”, “Natural phenomena” (rain, rainbow, lightning, etc.).\r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! Besides English, this app also supports the German, Russian and Ukrainian languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their foreign language teachers and classmates. An A+ is sure to follow! \r\n\r\nIn order to use this educational app, the youngster does not need to be able to read. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently!\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\r\n\r\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MWBLPT502CF","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Disneyland Adventures Demo","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27453.13842547315008168.95d8f6e5-c971-4c8d-82b2-c4c14f380c05.90e576db-8b1e-479f-8a53-6bca007b360f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5007.13842547315008168.8cd36755-c480-4f20-b54a-afb9d59d16a8.a5dcf588-dab0-4e59-af3a-9a56629ed406","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38755.13842547315008168.0e4e6d67-22da-40e5-b520-630686e37930.1b015e51-522d-465d-8731-92ea67e12de6","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Feex","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.DisneylandAdventuresDemo_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["6bbade64-681b-945e-60dd-901a4ff24d61","d718d310-2e41-f7c8-d376-f6706faa1d3e","a8e99d45-9cdc-4be5-9c48-bc49e9ab1dbc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"\"Experience the magic of Disneyland like never before!
