The game revolves around a transportation business where you play the role of a car transporter & cargo contractor. Cars, airplane, cruise ships and cargo truck driving. A new challenge in simulation to accomplish. Be a real cargo truck driver, an airplane pilot, a car transporter, a cruise ship sailor and a heavy crane operator. A new chapter in transport and simulation games. You have decided to open a transporter business. As the contractor you need to transport cargo, cars and other luggage via roads, sea and air. Take international transportation contracts and grow your business.\r\n\r\nFerry port transporter will allow you to enjoy multiple driving and simulation experiences. Fly airplane, sail big ferry & drive cars into the ship. A classic simulation game with airplane flying, car diving, ship sailing and cargo transport tasks. A whole new environment with exotic City, docks and airport for airplane flight and landings. A transporter game to load and transport cargo to destinations with road, air and sea travelling. Fly over the blue water and travel to different cities to transport goods through your cargo plane. Driving on roads might be an easy task but airplane flight is not easy to handle. The objective of the game is all about transportation. Deploy your vehicles for multiple tasks and build your transport industry as a transportation city contractor.\r\n\r\nThe transport story begins with car driving inside the city and reaching the docks where you will park the cars inside the cruise ship, taking the cargo later to the other island. Some tasks would feature airplane flight to transport cars and luggage to the other cities. Operate heavy cranes to lift containers into the big trucks. Truck driving is also an important part of the game with airport transport and transportation inside the city as well.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5F54K","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Little Foot Doctor - Crazy Surgery Game","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41241.13510798887028034.a90678f7-e832-421e-9ec5-ba3411a71617.d7e93a2c-ebd5-4e40-aa41-f18fe697dfd7","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20219.13510798887028034.5d286f4a-3aac-422f-89c7-35237d120aaf.ccb78cec-33df-407a-9f49-897c050ad1ef","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21601.13510798887028034.7b56c8a2-61e6-468c-b3f1-b5c8a10709e1.54bb6245-7e62-4c49-a32d-b64969901c59","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42013.13510798887028034.f32ce115-dd96-4250-b555-0fedf729b6ef.8b89c06d-c394-4668-8d5f-fbdff78ff9dc","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59646.13510798887028034.f165593b-addb-4aa9-968e-7bb546bbd438.adaa793c-dbc9-4557-bfb7-f73688223f2d","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31878.13510798887028034.437fb938-ee4e-4853-ab71-63f1bd5f4de8.84864208-aa11-4e10-8e60-868bc5adc5a1","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53672.13510798887028034.7a227fc6-e0b3-4ce9-a324-0543f7773c73.b850532f-86ae-43f5-8f5f-417ba5835dbf","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25949.13510798887028034.c5ec557c-814b-4d96-a79f-3547014673a4.6b9405d1-c8a3-4b38-9862-2ad5cb77328b","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.49381.13510798887028034.37c0b483-6b3b-4551-9282-afe2eba00ab1.ce8a47fa-2900-455a-bd00-00a81146124e","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17185.13510798887028034.bb79ae6a-301c-4771-ad24-7d9c11f993e8.c3c283e9-1ff0-438d-99a7-d6b2f7d44246","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["UnitMGames.FootDoctorSurgerySimulator_tt48tp7szpztr"],"ContentIds":["8b5553e2-dac0-112e-56b6-ff34e70723fe","6bbdd3a8-c02e-a603-cdd5-5c20bfa1642a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"What fun it is to be a little doctor!

Grave after grave... I couldn't bear to be a part of that anymore. The issue was so big, so consuming, and the world had forgotten about the horrors confronted on the battlefield: a child's burnt sock on the side of the road, blood spattered alleyways, the haunting stench of death and the ring of a report playing on repeat in your head as you try to sleep at night... and the look on the target's face as the blood drained from his body. But it this was war, and the law of a good soldier was a lack of feeling. Numbing my emotions and attachments to the people and places I visited was a challenge, but I soon realized the benefit... because now I was unstoppable.\r\n\r\n**** INTENSE GAME PLAY **** \r\nLaunch a fun, fast-paced 3D mobile gaming experience upon downloading this addictive FPS game. Strike fast and kill enemies in this combat challenge. Collect ammo, HP and speed pickups as you advance. These pickups will decrease though, while the number of enemies increases significantly.
