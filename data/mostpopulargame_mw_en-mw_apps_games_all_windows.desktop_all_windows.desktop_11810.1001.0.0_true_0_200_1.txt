That’s right, you shoot those marbles with other marbles in order to remove marbles. Sounds silly, but that's how it is! Aim with your Tiki stone to shoot marbles of the same color into the chain. If you match 3 or more marbles they will disappear.\r\n\r\nBigger combos will grant bigger bonuses and even specials. And if that’s not enough for you there are power ups that will assist you greatly in your challenge to eliminate brightly colored rolling marbles.\r\n\r\nOf course there are power ups. For example there is a fire power-up that will allow you to spit awesome fire balls for a short amount of time and destroy all marbles that get in the way. No need to match 3 marbles, just shoot fireballs wherever you want.\r\n\r\nAnother fan favorite is the lightning power-up that will randomly shoot lightning beams and destroy several marbles across the screen at once. A really helpful feature is the option to swap between two marbles before every shot. If you don’t find a good spot to shoot a marble, swapping may give you a big advantage.\r\n\r\nBut either way your one and only goal is to destroy the whole chain of marbles before the first marble reaches the exit. So your main antagonist is time. And your aiming skills, of course.\r\n\r\nIf you loved Peggle Montezuma, marble woka woka Zuma Deluxe, World of Zuma or Zumas Temple Quest, you will love this game. Zuma Totemia is the perfect game for all Match 3 fans that want a little more action and excitement.

It is said that Captain James Cook used to play a variant of Connect 4 with his fellow officers on his long voyages, and so this game has also been called \"Captain's Mistress\".\r\nConnect4 is named Force4, or Puissance4 in French, Forza4 in Italian, Conecta4 in Spanish, 4gewinnt in German, 4 op'n rij in Dutch, Fire på stribe in Danish, Neljän suora in Finnish, Czwórki in Polish, Четыре в ряд in Russian, 四子棋 in Chinese, and 四目並べ in Japanese...\r\n\r\nThe contemporary Connect4 game was launched by Milton Bradley at the beginning of the 70s. It consists of 7 columns, each 6 pieces high. This game is a neat conversion of a classic game where the aim is to connect four tokens in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, while keeping your opponent from doing the same. Sounds easy, but it is not! The \"vertical\" strategy you need to play Connect4 creates a unique challenge: you must think in a whole new way to block your opponent’s moves.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs any successful game, Connect 4 has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny \r\ndownload package, including powerful AI engine with 3 different difficult levels, ability to play against other person or the phone, undo and hints. \r\nUse menu (top right corner) to activate all those features","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDM5SG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Jago Trainer","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12217.9007199266445213.9dafa2fa-a645-4a60-a032-900ee821b566.90f3d45b-ee04-41ca-b9da-2bf2a95b2d27","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10092.9007199266445213.c84614ce-87b4-4c78-a9f6-7723e7d97133.f9ec0714-2af5-454b-a253-8bb89aae30e7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32378.9007199266445213.fe2757f9-ae52-432e-a794-5da44ab332ba.12bbabec-34af-4f5c-821b-a5a2563f5956","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["37262DancingChimps.JagoTrainer_ys9a80gm9xb10"],"ContentIds":["812d89ed-32db-7e1e-bc34-8669080d5ebc","3c9b7083-a4e6-065d-5bfc-7d3d967f5294"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If you keep getting beaten by Jago in Killer Instinct on Xbox One, this app will help you train to identify his auto doubles.\r\nMimic the action on the right thumbstick of your controller by swiping up, down, left and right to break the combos that Jago throws your way.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDQSL1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Tic-tac-toe Universe 4D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59613.9007199266542602.8c067ac2-9e7a-460a-bfe9-ce44856ecd69.63c7f998-bfcc-4079-b15d-09ce9403023b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#002C5B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["53430TrumpSoftware.Tic-tac-toeUniverse_xqb6kmrnnyfrr"],"ContentIds":["c7bcedff-748d-c54e-33f1-2ab14ed945f1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"We all familiar with the \"Tic-Tac-Toe\" game since childhood.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber.

The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFHW53","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Royal Revolt 2: Tower Defense","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24173.9007199266247002.d52fde37-a7e2-4148-8b90-9a34a2a63e0a.19374d8c-6948-44b0-8ea8-57bcf3e8ac43","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22712.9007199266247002.d52fde37-a7e2-4148-8b90-9a34a2a63e0a.99a19323-e1b6-47f1-8436-022e72db10ed","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40192.9007199266247002.d52fde37-a7e2-4148-8b90-9a34a2a63e0a.4f9ade3f-e103-4716-b712-7bff743807eb","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23578.9007199266247002.f808d2b6-2d27-415d-a5f2-419c40ab1b69.53b130b3-da98-4e6b-87bd-d97eb37833d8","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27436.9007199266247002.f808d2b6-2d27-415d-a5f2-419c40ab1b69.fb320e4e-efa4-44fc-8d58-01c6e879b7ab","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8891.9007199266247002.f808d2b6-2d27-415d-a5f2-419c40ab1b69.6a41d330-eed7-43ac-a407-eda8e0034a57","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9255.9007199266247002.067e6587-1719-4500-abb2-8166ab286d12.eed03dd3-6ffc-4fc5-927e-52950841dba6","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26157.9007199266247002.067e6587-1719-4500-abb2-8166ab286d12.fbb9ce73-dbbf-4e37-9cd5-af9ec811ba1e","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7643.9007199266247002.067e6587-1719-4500-abb2-8166ab286d12.f4754a1a-a9ce-4bca-8fbc-3dfb21079e76","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["flaregamesGmbH.RoyalRevolt2_g0q0z3kw54rap"],"ContentIds":["660171a4-f232-6a85-09b3-a5f6d2c356e6","e7227e16-2c2c-5d0e-048c-c3c70b23cc4e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"\"Action-packed game that will keep you entertained with its many layers\" - YAHOO!\r\n\r\nRoyal Revolt 2 is an action-packed strategy game.

It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill!

Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and dealer and played with one or more French decks of 52 cards.\r\nThe player is dealt an initial two card hand with the option of drawing cards to bring the total value to 21 or less without exceeding it, so that the dealer will lose by having a lesser hand than the player or by exceeding 21. Since the 1960s, blackjack has been a high profile target of advantage players, particularly card counters, who track the profile of cards yet to be dealt, and adapt their wager and playing strategy accordingly. While in our implementation we do not teach counting, we do offer basic strategy hints to train you on how to improve your odds.\r\nMany rule variations of BlackJack exist. Our implementation offers most common casino rules:\r\n- Play with 4 decks\r\n- Decks are reshuffled when there is less than 20 cards left.\r\n- Dealer stands on soft 17\r\n- Player can split twice\r\n- Neither surrender nor insurance are offered\r\nWhen hints are enabled, player would need to confirm his choice if it's not the most optimum action.\r\nWhen you running short on credits, feel free to use our build in slot machine - truly the loosest slots in town!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDT0RD","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Mini Golf Stars 2: Putt Putt Golfing","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45407.9007199266602865.062448d8-77a9-4d2f-b70b-c9c291256ee1.afac77fe-8ae9-4277-b351-41d880d9465e","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.487.9007199266602865.3a8f857f-f436-42c8-aadd-b1e5d876cfdc.75fdfe4f-f1ff-41a6-8087-94e02f0d4a5a","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GameMasons.MiniGolfStars2PuttPuttGolfing_7mc5604mzq226"],"ContentIds":["1eef75ec-a9d8-4810-9387-ec5e58a4379f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Mini Golf Stars is back and better than ever!

On top of the downturned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most downturned pile, and downturned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card. The piles should look like the figure to the right.\r\n\r\nThe four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with 2 and ending with King, all of the same suit. Once this is accomplished, the goal is to move this to a foundation, where the player has previously placed the Ace of that suit. Once the player has done this, they will have \"finished\" that suit, the goal being, of course, to finish all suits, at which time the player would have won. There are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck:\r\n\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste, either allowing three passes through the deck or placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once, reversing the order of each group of three as the cards are dealt.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but only passing through the deck once.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste with no limit on passes through the deck, but allowing the player to switch once to a single pass through the deck one card at a time; after that single pass, however, the player cannot go back to turning three cards at a time and can turn over no more cards from the waste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PFVH1N42N63","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Operation: New Earth","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.320.14193109004939536.b6104262-c0bd-4c32-80d2-1597d8e7697f.5289da7a-5ff1-459e-a22d-f967830755c1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#083056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51931.14193109004939536.b6104262-c0bd-4c32-80d2-1597d8e7697f.402c1379-c337-4e29-8a54-0b4762b6e4c3","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#083056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61058.14193109004939536.b6104262-c0bd-4c32-80d2-1597d8e7697f.f59652af-b9ce-4648-ade0-e21e65857b1c","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#083056","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3538.14193109004939536.bd604903-dd93-4cf8-801d-4440f74b3507.ce44cbda-9747-4e19-a489-7feb5affc706","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["TiltingPoint.OperationNewEarth_85kh3h6wfjavg"],"ContentIds":["4617d8d5-86ad-e415-9db6-6540551bd32b","af92ac9c-6984-b500-bb16-0abcb486c65c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Earth.

Pull off 360 spins, handstands, snowboard nose-grabs, and strike daring poses - each animal has their own stylish moves!\r\n\r\n- Collect coins to purchase new gear, crazy costumes and powerful vehicles in the shop! Isn't it time you thought about that gold sled you always wanted?\r\n\r\n- Take photos of your epic moments and share them with the world! Set up an amazing photo opportunity and spin the camera around for that perfect shot - all in glorious 3D!\r\n\r\n- Three exciting locations are waiting for you to explore...\r\n\r\nPENGUIN PEAKS\r\n\r\nIt's the snowy slope we loved from Ski Safari, but it's had a Mammoth makeover! Find the frozen Mammoth inside a cave and try to tame him. Or grind across the cables of the after-hours chairlifts. And best of all, grab a snowmobile and pull off epic jumps once more!\r\n\r\nJURASSIC LARK\r\n\r\nIt's about time. A jurassic jungle full of prehistoric pals like the Pterodactyl, the Woolly Mammoth and a baby Ankylosaurus. These ancient animals have a dino-mite plan for our intrepid stars! Race against the \"Lavalanche\", slide along vines, or just go crazy performing tricks as you try to avoid rocks, stalactites and pools of molten lava!\r\n\r\nTWISTER CANYON\r\n\r\nPerhaps the gentle rolling of the tumbleweeds is more your pace. Unfortunately, they didn't call it Twister Canyon for nothing. A fierce twister is headed straight for Sven and Evana! They just can't catch a break, can they?\r\n\r\nHere you'll find an assortment of ragtag rapscallions including Sheriff Yeti, Chief Penguin, and even an Armadillo! Ride in a mine cart, hop on a rickety railway, grind along a telegraph wire or watch the Yeti play the piano! It's how the wild, wild west was meant to be.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH20B2R","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Gangster Vegas: City Crime","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.7774.13510798886217564.badb83b5-f028-439b-9cd5-e0a0ceff2041.4ec662db-47a1-41d2-9000-ee04047f29af","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.2016.13510798886217564.3b061faf-20ec-4a87-9d3a-4442ba38ac14.70319b3f-0384-48d7-a7b0-1cc9ea33bef4","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34747.13510798886217564.1224655c-2101-4ccc-a59e-64aa468be751.1c00de65-a56f-435f-a438-bd10c9a3801e","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["56499UkArtsGames.GangsterVegasCityCrime_ep77ya5xk0qyg"],"ContentIds":["2ed62570-ba17-4af7-8421-5454df8cad52","9d833045-6d68-285a-5e9f-94e0440fc4f9"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"**Dominate!
