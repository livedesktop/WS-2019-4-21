How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MSRVJ2KGC21","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Fancy Blast","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44423.13826856819047214.42c986b3-f1d0-434f-b6be-01338e35cd40.0f3acd20-db31-42d0-9582-b243ab55c137","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#008CC5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61098.13826856819047214.75c680bc-9459-4e47-8794-ea9c152ddd6c.b57937ad-3c28-4d3b-86d0-a7919968f0aa","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#008CC5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2860.13826856819047214.d4f43dbc-2294-4fcc-97bf-1e52dd1b5bb5.93bd4431-abe5-447d-8d89-0c987982dd0a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#008CC5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43899.13826856819047214.4e752016-b5b9-4f95-ba65-a6296d1ea019.6efa492e-7abb-48dd-b9de-98aa0eb4ef91","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#008CC5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9267.13826856819047214.4e6c5cc1-bca2-46aa-92c0-5b3a3a6e1891.69557ad0-18d0-43e8-abd8-520dfed09615","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#008CC5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18634.13826856819047214.7a55a8f2-42f9-4a0a-b799-4a34dae40de4.8af6fabc-e5c3-42cb-802e-cd4f1bbb310b","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#008CC5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60109.13826856819047214.ae8c30bd-2101-422e-8075-878104967504.63ca214b-cc87-4b45-80ab-23ef885ab2ee","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7872.13826856819047214.1fa727d8-1489-4139-ac52-89b973b724b8.225bd288-aa74-43b0-9ad5-3ba008f083ac","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#008CC5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13556.13826856819047214.4f1077ac-ae8a-44ee-8abf-5710c86968d1.bcbc5564-e2de-48c7-a6a2-2d837208e6bd","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["FenomenGames.FancyBlast_2qabtctawhj04"],"ContentIds":["67a26c46-eee8-d8e4-dda1-5f43ea11fd88","91acc316-21b5-65e1-9d02-6197436aab10"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Help our hero Aurora to find all the parts of magical structures on unique Match-3 levels!\r\nGAME FEATURES:\r\n\r\n* 860+ new Match-3 levels!\r\n* Dozens of fairy tale worlds with unique characters.\r\n* Surprising plot turns.\r\n* Huge number of exciting tasks.\r\n* Secret episode available for a limited period of time\r\n* Ability to play with your friends\r\n\r\nNew types of Match-3 levels:\r\n\r\n* Magic flower -

The powerful domain of the kingdom attracts enemies of all kinds, each more dangerous and devastating to the realm's armies than the last. \r\n\r\nThe king's reign has been threatened, and his personal sorcerer believes he has come up with a way to pull on ancient magic to ensure protection of castle and king, but something terrible and unexpected occurred during the spell and now a dark and mysterious force now looms large over the lands. It is only a matter of time before the day of reckoning descends over the nations and heralds the realms to a new age and dominate empire. \r\n\r\nCenturies of Feuding...\r\nThey'd inherited the feud from their fathers and couldn't recall the original cause. Perhaps they knew not who started it or why, but they certainly knew who would end it and how. Blinking up at the glaring light, the dark centers of the warrior's blazing eyes seemed to sear the air around the fierce brute. The magician stood back- pleased, yet on edge at what to expect. The spell was complete. The Druid Warlord of legend was born, and he was ready to go to war for the people of Komkaria. The Warlord lurched upright, and the glint of a candlelight flashed off his blade as it swung viciously through the air. \"Traitor!\" the Warlord growled. As the blade found its mark, and the blood gurgled up in the throat of the magician, he realized the one fatal flaw in his spell...\r\n\r\nGive it Your Best Shot...\r\nFight your way against dozens of ultimate foes as you guard the mighty powers of this impressive temple of war. The forceful soul of the guardian spirit is potent within these walls, but whose side does he champion?

I know little about my origins, only that the planet had seen a total annihilation of human life centuries ago at the hands of the robots who dominated it and I was the last human on earth. I exist in a cell so tiny that I cannot lay flat, but rather have to sleep in the fetal position. My cell is always cold and drips waste from the city above. I have seen light very few times in my existence, but when I have, I was chained in manacles and paraded about the city to the delight of the robots and their fat, alien comrades. I harbored no hope of leaving this place. That was, until six months ago when I heard it whispered between wardens that a planet was discovered where humans not only exist, they thrive. The word war was being bandied about, but I cared naught of their tactics, for the first bloom of hope had sprung to life in my chest. For the first time since I was a wee boy and my spunk was beaten mercilessly from me, I was determined to be more than a prisoner. Despite the size of my cage, I refused to let my surroundings hinder my plans of escape. I worked out tirelessly, working my weary bones until I could start to feel the strength building in my body. I would escape, but to fully succeed and reunite with those of my own ilk, I would need to confront these foes and escape this hell hole altogether. This is my tale, the story of how I escaped this planet and vanquished my enemies.\r\n\r\n??Ready your weapons...??\r\n\r\nThis mission features a great variety of enemies, but when you start the game, you will be unarmed.

Your entity map will be a valuable asset as it allows you an aerial view of oncoming enemies so you can be prepared to strike. Collect health and ammo perks while you can, for these pickups will decrease as the levels progress making your mission all the more challenging. Let your surroundings aid your quest. Exploding barrels can be found and utilized to strategically take down enemies. Enjoy non-stop FPS action with endless battles and treacherous terrain. \r\n\r\nHow to play: Use the simple touch screen control pad to easily move, fight, select weapons and more.

The 28 domino tiles are shuffled face down and form the stock or boneyard. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge before the players, so that each player can see his own domino tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay. One player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. In different games first tiles are also different. In Muggins player should start with the highest double (6-6), in Bergen the first move should be 0-0, in Mexican train each round starts with the next lower double. This tile starts the line of play, a series of tiles in which adjacent tiles touch with matching, i.e. equal, values. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.\r\n- Scoring game\r\nPlayers accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. In Muggins (All fives) player must make the open ends of the layout add up to 5s or a multiple of five (5s, 10, 15, 20, etc.) In bergen player scores when numbers on the open ends are equal. If a player does not call \"domino\" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says 'domino' after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino. In Mexican train the double zero domino is scored as 50 points.\r\n- Draw game\r\nIn a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile. The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock. The Draw game is often referred to as simply \"dominos\".\r\n\r\nIf you like board games like Checkers, Mahjong, Backgammon and Chess, you will love Dominoes: Best Classic Dominoes Board Game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MT5LSM6VQQS","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Pixel Knight Adventures","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34080.13814754316737363.3893511a-0c79-41e8-aeda-dbf60f3bdec9.78ff931d-7950-481e-bc69-4181277e9d56","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26010.13814754316737363.451efdf7-6dd5-491f-af09-4a8098dd5682.b785666a-ee65-45e2-923c-325f1b989346","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22825.13814754316737363.7f90af5f-45b8-4af4-a4a5-a7a2a3ce39a7.b45ca7bc-9245-4bc1-8f03-5d8f30cbce10","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["AMGames.PixelKnightAdventures_0et4xf6j5enw4"],"ContentIds":["cb79cdf2-7834-0324-cf9a-816e36311a1c","cb04c03a-74a6-5b97-7571-7a3499e9a379"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Pixel Knight – welcome to the Middle Ages!

As in a puzzle, you have a board and you must find out which symbol – or piece - goes in each box  \r\n\r\n👽 and where is the logic?\r\n🙂 the game gives you logical clues, so you can deduce what symbol goes in what box  \r\n\r\n👽 What do you mean by logical clues?\r\n🙂 the logical clues are of the style of:  these pieces are on the board and these others are not, or only one of these two is correct, or at least one of these two pieces is not correct. or ...  \r\n\r\n👽 and that is logic?\r\n🙂 Absolutely. It’s based on the propositional logic. Propositional logic is universal, and all of us use it even without noticing it.\r\n\r\nIt means that everyone can to follow this logic. Apparently, the clues hide the response of the game, but from the clues you can deduce the correct answers  \r\n\r\n👽 Is it like in an intriguing or detective novel?\r\n🙂 You can also see it that way. The reasoning can be similar, you must find a clue to start, chain clues, follow false leads and discard them, realize that if something is false, it can mean that something else is true. \r\n\r\nYes, in fact, every time we reason in a logical way, we do it in the same way: in a logical way  \r\n\r\n👽 Ok, start to like me. Tell me more\r\n🙂I assure you that when you deduct the clues and arrive at the solution you take a joy. \r\n\r\nThe challenge is fun. \r\n\r\nIt's not exactly liked a novel or a detective movie because the game is totally symbolic. It is a board game and you can play again and again, and each game is different  \r\n\r\n👽 but it seems that you should use the same skill, right? \r\n🙂 Certainly, as we have said before, the logic used in ItsLogic is universal. You can even see it as a logic gym. \r\n\r\nIn that sense, you can be sure that it will help you develop your logical thinking while you are enjoying yourself  \r\n\r\n👽 Is it easy?\r\n🙂 You can imagine that you start easy and it gets complicated, but with ItsLogic  you can always decide the level of complexity in which you want to play in each moment. \r\n\r\nIn addition, sometimes you want to play a series of simple and fast games, while other times you want the challenge of a complex game    \r\n\r\n👽 What if you get stuck?\r\n🙂 Practically all of us will find levels of the game that are easy for us, other levels that will be a challenge and other levels that seem impossible.\r\n\r\nAs we continue to dominate the game the bar will go up and more and more games will be affordable.\r\n\r\nBut sooner or later, as normal, we can find games that we do not know how to deal with:  You get stuck, and that is annoying.\r\n\r\nMany times, we would just need an idea, or an example, other times we would just have to have some tool, such as being able to point out what we are deducting, or that something or someone tells you what the next step is. ItsLogic knows that\r\n\r\nItsLogic has a lot of help tools so you never get stuck. You can use the tools to learn, to get a push or just to adapt the game to the level of complexity you want. \r\n\r\nStaying stuck is not fun and solving games is fun. \r\n\r\nWith ItsLogic you can solve from the simplest game to the most complex. It's part of the game.\r\n\r\n👽 It's logical, I'm going to develop my logical thinking while I'm having fun, I'm not going to be alone if I get stuck ... I'm going to try it\r\n\r\n🙂 Well, sounds logical\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MVMW0WPXVXB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Flappy Bird !!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59047.13855903325595693.c044493e-388c-4de5-8f46-2cfbd5fe8d12.208b150b-fd90-4b47-914d-46f430c372a9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48856.13855903325595693.c044493e-388c-4de5-8f46-2cfbd5fe8d12.b60e5e7d-308c-4b03-905d-5a481c17670d","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["29419NewFreeGoodGames.FlappyBird_f2csh8nw1151c"],"ContentIds":["c7400e13-cc1d-d827-36eb-fbd3b490f761","63056857-192c-18c4-ebc6-1e43e2e6e3bd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Have you always wanted play Flappy Bird ?\r\nHere it is original legendary game Flappy Bird !\r\n\r\nLet your bird fly and flappy as long as possible through the obstacles.\r\nAs in Flappy Bird you only need to tap the screen to let your bird fly: it's easy and fun!\r\n\r\nFlying bird: Arcade game is a fun and addictive flying bird game that will steal your free time.\r\n\r\nExperience the adventure of Floppy Bird, the flying floppy disk, through the world by dodging obstacles.

Survival Games! An epic action game filled with unimaginable battles in full, 3D pixelated graphics awaits you in the ruins of an ancient civilization where it's either kill or be killed. \r\n\r\nTrapped in the wilds of a remote jungle village lurks one of the world's most powerful and deadly clans known to exist. Thought only a myth, you've since discovered that their brutal rituals have unleashed havoc on the ruins of an old religious temple and burial ground. Sensing your presence, mighty warriors that once defended the island from outsiders such as yourself have risen again to annihilate the threat to their remote location. The hell gates have opened and a flood of demon foes have spilled fourth to hunt you down courtesy of the witch doctor who wants your head on a platter.\r\n\r\nIn a world overrun with the dead, your mission is one of survival. Battle legendary enemies and discover a world full of diverse challenges. The ultimate FPS showdown is at hand and you must tear through waves of enemies with only one goal--your death. Test your skills, plan your moves, and above all, reserve your shots or risk losing everything. The epic action of this first person shooter action game is one of legendary proportions and now you are in the midst of it. Battle your way to victory and discover the secrets these clansmen hold close.

It is one of the best known board games of all-time.\r\n\r\nThe classic fast-trading property game features tokens from the 1930s all the way to the 2000s, with a beautiful game board and cards, the game takes you back to when it all began, but you still have to build your houses and hotels and see if you can bankrupt everyone else. The jet-set gameplay will be epic as you race around the world to visit the world’s most exciting places and buy locations.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is also known popularly called Business Board Game, The Landlord's Game and Finance\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a great game for 2 - 6 players. It is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and develop them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nMoney can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.\r\n\r\nPlay against the computer, against your friends in Local mode or with Thousands of Onopoly players around the world in Online Multiplayer Mode.\r\n\r\nYou can also create Private Rooms and invite your friends to play in Play with Friends Mode.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a simple game: you start off with some money, and your goal is to be the last player standing with money. The way you win in Monopoly is by collecting rents on property, or cash flow.\r\n\r\nOnopoly brilliantly combines both strategy and chance. It gets stressful and exciting, especially when things get closer to the endgame. \r\n\r\nYou better keep an eye on your money, because you never know when the dice will land you with a massive rent bill to pay. Sometimes staying in jail can be the safest place to be, but only after your properties are primed to make you money.\r\n\r\nYou’ve got to buy, sell and negotiate to win. Everyone loves the timeless game-play of Onopoly. \r\n\r\nTry to win the onopoly game by buying all the property and collecting as much money as possible. \r\nWill you be able to defeat your opponents? \r\n\r\nDownload Onopoly for free!!\r\n\r\n◆◆◆◆ Onopoly Features◆◆◆◆\r\n\r\n✔ Create Private Room and Invite Friends and Family\r\n✔ True multiplayer where you can play with real people
