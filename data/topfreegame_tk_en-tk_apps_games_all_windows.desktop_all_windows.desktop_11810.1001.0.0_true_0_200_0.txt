Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4V5B9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Smart Boxing Champion Fighter","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8856.13510798887492286.1921b4a0-b6e2-4fb6-a6f9-1c1a5ea0a30a.3cef66b7-86d1-4e9f-a28e-97bf04564299","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51571.13510798887492286.99d3f6fb-a5b7-4754-b35d-528ca1f5c96b.50a8f88b-b063-4220-b200-61a420482b1a","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37156.13510798887492286.51e6306f-4e22-46b9-9ba5-07e5d8c970f4.f177e516-0418-440d-a504-291a5692a9ad","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["34335TopiTapiGames.SmartBoxingChampionFighter_wa68eadphfe3r"],"ContentIds":["44f38eca-57e5-95f3-9943-0c9cf9e6fb02","dccb7993-c369-118c-1d43-24a86d51dd0f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Smart-Boxing is a combat boxing game, in which you have to fight with other boxers … you have to defeat them to go further… just select a player and an opponent and play boxing.\r\n\r\nHow to Play:\r\n\r\n- Select an opponent from Opponent Selection\r\n- Start fight by punching rights & lefts\r\n- Navigate buttons to punch the other boxer\r\n- When you win... go back to main menu\r\n- Go to Skill Shop to update your boxer skills and go fight again\r\n- You can also choose the ring-environment\r\n\r\nGame Modes:\r\n\r\nPractice mode: \r\nIn which you can learn the smart boxing.

After the approval of high rise apartment building and commercial malls, the whole demographics of the town have changed. Before you would have the bowling clubs and theatre halls for the elderly, now it is more about the poker machines and pubs, not to say the brutal death racing circuit. You can understand the feelings of these retired people, after what they see their in shape of death race or even car wars not to say the roadkill.\r\n\r\nThe peaceful town is full with the noise and tyre burning after all this death race, and with the speed and intensity they drift and slip on the tracks. The locals came together for a quick meeting, they knew that the champion of the death race circuit will always have the final say about the operation of the brutal death racing circuit. So they came up with this idea, to hire a road warrior, who knows all the art of death race or car wars. They needed someone who is a master of drift or slip on these death tracks and has perfected all the skills of roadkill, by bumping hard or shooting through your turrets and missile. You can do that only if you can save yourself through your drifting skills and making the car slip from end to end. Only then you can be a road warrior and a champion of the brutal death racing circuit.\r\nSo be that death race driver for today, practice all your car wars skills, drift and slip is part of that. Bump hard or shoot, whatever is on the cards. Please come out as ultimate road warrior and a champion of the death race circuit to stop further roadkill and nasty attitude towards the elderly civilians.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NCJD79R0JVR","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Snow Town - Ice Village World","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30863.13567623013775892.d9bc0246-8ffc-49da-a5df-6c9fd665bb64.88722369-8667-4ded-9dc6-ac5c6d94cbdf","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8051.13567623013775892.d9bc0246-8ffc-49da-a5df-6c9fd665bb64.21236790-92f2-4996-83d4-91ee298e4964","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2516.13567623013775892.d9bc0246-8ffc-49da-a5df-6c9fd665bb64.16df5dc3-e3df-418b-a558-1f71252e935c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.194.13567623013775892.d9bc0246-8ffc-49da-a5df-6c9fd665bb64.405e4aa6-a59a-49a6-9664-1c5221015019","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62480.13567623013775892.d9bc0246-8ffc-49da-a5df-6c9fd665bb64.5bc67663-e30a-4f1a-be08-ba76ff663522","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13905.13567623013775892.d9bc0246-8ffc-49da-a5df-6c9fd665bb64.3a5f96b5-8c73-4037-be2a-31a9d1c9fae2","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26866.13567623013775892.d9bc0246-8ffc-49da-a5df-6c9fd665bb64.c93f8e5c-3b5e-4a0d-844c-40f47b440457","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11181.13567623013775892.d9bc0246-8ffc-49da-a5df-6c9fd665bb64.fa517a3f-51bf-4ad1-ad0a-9486d53e0c47","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8485.13567623013775892.d9bc0246-8ffc-49da-a5df-6c9fd665bb64.aa4d20ac-c454-48a8-9e42-76dbf0d25697","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46774.13567623013775892.3f14351e-b582-4c90-a061-5d147c58fd37.d3493e6b-e887-484c-8cd3-0b547af97492","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["SparklingSociety.SnowTown-IceVillageWorld_cechnmvjdb364"],"ContentIds":["c1f600f0-e351-6459-f948-39928073a378","94a6839f-8db7-1c63-21c5-676f29fd9c4a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"City building game “Snow Town” is the ultimate challenge for ambitious mayors and creative city designers.

My bird has a huge passion for mini golf but there are no golf clubs (sticks) and balls to play with, he has reinvented the game concept.\r\nHe blows up his clumsy body until he looks like a ball and uses a slingshot to move towards the hole.\r\nAfter the first shot the game play will change from slingshot modus to arrow modus with a power bar, for a more precise stroke.\r\nAdvice: Remember that the first hit will be the most difficult, so do not put too much strength in it because it will simply make our fluffy friend, fly out of the track. Don't hit the bird into the sea - it doesn't like to be a subsurfer...\r\n\r\nCool gamefeat:\r\n- Awesome 3D graphics\r\n- Cute animal characters and animations with dancing birds\r\n- 4 fun courses with over 70 holes\r\n- Simple, drag-and-release gameplay mechanic for the slingshot\r\n- Direction arrow with power bar for the successive stroke - just touch it\r\n- Realistic physics and ball movement\r\n- Collectible coins and jewels to increase your score\r\n- Easy and funny to play\r\n\r\nTry to find the shortest and easiest path to the hole in order to rise your score. Let's make it with no more than 3 par (hits) and you will get three stars.\r\nThere are also collectible coins and jewels that can increase your final score like crazy.\r\n\r\nIf you collect one gem you will get back one par (stroke) which means that you have higher possibilities to get 3 stars.\r\n\r\nEnjoy hours of fun with this challenging free app!

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day.

Grave after grave... I couldn't bear to be a part of that anymore.

But it this was war, and the law of a good soldier was a lack of feeling. Numbing my emotions and attachments to the people and places I visited was a challenge, but I soon realized the benefit... because now I was unstoppable.\r\n\r\n**** INTENSE GAME PLAY **** \r\nLaunch a fun, fast-paced 3D mobile gaming experience upon downloading this addictive FPS game.
